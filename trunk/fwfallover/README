fwfallover.pl
=============

This is just a tiny perl script I made to make two firewalls perform 
simple fallover using the serial port as well as ICMP echo requests 
and replies.

Basically its just a simple master/slave relation. Master is the side
that comes up first and the slave checks if master is up, if not, the
slave will try to become the master itself.

The script is very much written for fwbuilder scripts but will execute
any other script you specify. (Just bear in mind that in slave mode
this script will remove any IP from the system except of the one you
specify in $ThisFirewall and unless your specify some default blocking
rules on your firewall, it will be open until fwfallover.pl will enter
master mode.)
